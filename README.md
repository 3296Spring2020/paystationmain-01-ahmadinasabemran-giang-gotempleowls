The Lab Assignment Description:
  
The lab assignment had asked us to create a test that returns the total amount entered. Also, it asked us to create a test for cancelled amount not adding the returned amount. Also, it asked us to create a test for reseting the total to zero. Also, it asked us to create a test returns map containing one coin entered. Also, it asked us to create a test that returns a map containing a mixture of coins entered. Also, it asked us to make a test that returns a map that does not contain a key for a coin that is not being entered. Also, it asked us to create a test that clears the map after the call to buy and after a call to cancel. 
  
Both Parsa and Manuel have managed to implement everything that was asked as part of the lab assignment. Yes, Parsa has made additional functions to make things to run as smmothly as possible and not get everything mixed up and also messed up along the way. Parsa is eager to get the work done (part by part) as soon he has some free time available for completing it (part by part). He will be upset if he's his team member not wanting to get his part of the lab assignment done as time goes by and waits til a day before its due to be doing it.

Team Members:
  
Manuel Broco

He waited til a day before it was due to get his part of the lab assgnment done after sending him like 10 or so emails telling him exactly what he needs to do but he still waits til a day before the lab assignment is due.
  
Parsa Ahmadi Nasab Emran

He is eager to get his part of this lab assignment done as soon as he possibly can so he would more time for doing his assignments for his other CIS courses. He will never wait til a day before its due to get his part of the lab assignment done. He hates it when his team member does not know how to priorotize things that well.
 
Parsa's Contributions To This Lab Assignment:
  
Parsa has created this readme file that includes all of the information for both of the team members for this lab assignment. He made a test for returning the total entered. Also, he made a test for cancelled entry does not add to the amount returned. And he made a test for reseting the total to zero.
  
Parsa has defined and implemented the following functions for this lab assignment: (public int empty1();), (public int empty2();), (public int empty3();), and (public void cancel1();). He also defined the following function for his team member (Manuel): (Map<Integer, Integer> cancel2();). He also have added (map.clear();) to the following functions: (public void cancel();) and (public Receipt buy();).
  
Manuel's Contributions To This Lab Assignment:
  
Manuel has created a test for returning a map containing one coin entered. Also, he has created a test for returning a map containing a mixture of coins entered. Also, he has created a test for returning a map that does not contain a key for a coin that is not being entered. Also, he has created a test for clearing the map after calling the buy function. Also, he has created a test for clearing the map affter calling the cancel function. Also, he has implemented the (public Map<Integer, Integer> cancel2();) by using the map that Parsa had previously created for him.
